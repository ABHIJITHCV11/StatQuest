## Logistic Regression & Sigmoid Function Visualization
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that I put together to help understand the sigmoid function better. By plotting various components like e^(z), e^(-z), 1 + e^(-z), and 1 / (1 + e^(-z)), you can see how these functions behave across different values of z. 
It's a great way to get a visual grasp on what's happening under the hood in logistic regression.

## Correlation Calculation
Calculate the correlation between two variables and testing on sample data:
